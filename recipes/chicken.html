    <h1>Chicken, Sausage, Peppers, and Potatoes</h1>
    <p>Chicken, sausage, and peppers are roasted with Yukon Gold potatoes in a very hot oven until beautifully caramelized. You'll need a large, heavy-duty roasting pan (or a couple of smaller ones) for this delicious dish.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 large links hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>6 bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>½ pound assorted sweet peppers, seeded</li>
        <li>4 large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sausage links and cook until browned and fat begins to render, about 3 minutes per side. While they cook, lightly pierce sausages in several places with the tip of a sharp knife to release fats and juices. Remove from the heat and place on a cutting board to cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut cooled sausages into 2-inch slices; return to the skillet along with any accumulated juices from the cutting board.</li>
        <li>Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of each chicken thigh. Halve or quarter any large peppers.</li>
        <li>Place chicken and peppers into a large mixing bowl with onions, sausage and juices, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and mix with your hands until all ingredients are coated in oil, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a large, heavy-duty roasting pan. Evenly space chicken thighs with the skin facing up and position potatoes near the top.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and everything is caramelized, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped fresh Italian parsley.</li>
      </ol>
